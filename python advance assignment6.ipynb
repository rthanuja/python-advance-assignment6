    "1.Library\n",
    " A library is a set of functions / classes focusing on some problem domain.\n",
    " Libraries do not control the flow of program. Functions of libraries are called by the main program with some \n",
    " input and they return some output or provide some behaviour \n",
    " e.g, RecommendationEngine executable uses libraries for logging, data access, etc. to perform its job but the flow \n",
    " of program is controlled by the executable only.so,code in a library should not suppress exceptions because that would \n",
    " prevent the calling application from fulfilling alternate flow and logging requirements - \n",
    " it can catch exceptions and rethrow or provide expected output by catching exceptions.\n",
    "2.UI Application\n",
    " Almost all UI applications are written using some framework with the framework calling the application \n",
    " when there is some event. This makes the event handlers an entry point in to the application so exceptions \n",
    " should be caught on event handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Framework\n",
    " Framework is an implementation of Inversion of Control pattern. Framework discovers, loads and calls \n",
    " its plug-ins on events a plug-in is interested in. Both the framework and the plug-ins communicate with \n",
    " each other using known public interfaces. framework must handle exception in all the places where it is\n",
    " invoking methods on its plug-in. "
